    "\n",
    "By the end of this course learners should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have a better understanding of previously experienced Python objects\n",
    "- Be able to create simple classes to hold data\n",
    "- Be able to augment classes with complicated methods and powerful tools\n",
    "- Be familiar with:\n",
    "    - inheriting objects\n",

    "    - combining objects\n",
    "    - decorating objects\n",

    "**Learner requirements:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Learners should have a good level of experience with Python. Python knowledge of at least [Introduction to Python](https://learninghub.ons.gov.uk/course/view.php?name=introduction_to_python) and [experience creating functions](https://learninghub.ons.gov.uk/course/view.php?name=py_control_flow_loops_functions) is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Software requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks is essential for running this course. Jupyter should come with any installation of Anaconda. Code cells should be run as they are reached. If unfamiliar with notebooks, [basic training on Jupyter Notebooks](https://learninghub.ons.gov.uk/course/view.php?name=jupyter_notebooks) is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Essential:\n",
    "    - **`dataclasses`**\n",
    "    - **`datetime`**\n",
    "- Used for demonstration purposes only:\n",

    "    - **`scikit-learn`** (Course tested with version 0.23.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential packages should be readily available with any Python install. The demonstration ones are optional. \n",

    "### Everything in Python is an Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Orientated Programming is a fundamental part of Python, and one that every Python user, from those learning it for the first time, to those experienced performing complex data analysis and writing software packages, will have used - whether they know it or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first time a new learner runs **`.sort()`** or **`.pop()`** on a list, they are running code that is defined as part of the list object. When someone new to DataFrames and pandas looks at the **`.shape`** of a DataFrame, they are finding fundamental information that is part of their specific DataFrame object. \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"width:75%;height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:#003d59; opacity:0.75\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods and Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods and attributes belong to objects themselves. They are first defined when the object class is created, and then have some effect on any instance of that object. A method acts like a function specific to the object - **`.sort()`** will take the items in a list, and sort them as best it can - reordering the list object. An attribute acts like a variable specific to that object - A DataFrame will have a **`.shape`** attribute that just states, as a tuple, the number of columns and number of rows that are included in the data. This attribute will be overwritten anytime more rows are appended, or extra columns are added, as the DataFrame class updates it anytime the dimensions change. \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr style=\"width:75%;height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:#003d59; opacity:0.75\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "### General Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in Python is an object - any variable type will have some methods and attributes associated with it. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* List\n",
    "  * **`.pop()`** - method to remove an item and return it for use outside of the list\n",
    "  * **`.sort()`** - method to sort a list\n",
    "  * **`.count()`** - method to count the number of occurances of a value passed into the method\n",
    "* String\n",
    "  * **`.upper()`** - method to convert the string to upper case\n",
    "  * **`.split()`** - method to split the string by a specified character\n",
    "  * **`.__class__`** - returns the class of the object - in this case **`str`**\n",
    "* DataFrame\n",
    "  * **`.shape`** - attribute containing the size of the DataFrame\n",
    "  * **`.append()`** - method to appends rows or columns to the DataFrame\n",
    "  * **`.head()`** - method to display the first rows of the DataFrame\n",
    "  \n",
    "<hr style=\"width:75%;height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:#003d59; opacity:0.75\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we Create them Ourselves\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating our own classes allows us to model complicated real world entities by creating custom data types - for events, activities, customers. Connections between these entities can be built in - a customer could attend an event, and complete a specific activity at the event. When the class is created, the behaviour of entity can be defined, and code created to handle a variety of tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "For manipulating data, classes can be created to collate methods into an easy to understand structure. Popular packages used for analysis lean heavily into this - scikit-learn below has a LinearRegression class, which is a useful container for all the functions you might want to perform on a linear regression. Rather than having a variety of functions within sklearn with tediously long names to be fully descriptive - **`linear_model_linear_regression_coef_`**, **`linear_model_linear_regression_copy_X`**, a user can create a single linear regression **`lr`** object which contains all of the methods that might be needed. \n",

    "## Basic Class Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The keyword **`class`** is used to define a class in Python - much like **`def`** is used to define a function. At a glance, the syntax to define a class looks very similar to defining a function - the keyword **`class`**, followed by the name of the class, an optional open-close parentheses pair, and a colon:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parrot:\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parrot():\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the brackets, an existing class name can be passed - this allows for the class being defined to inherit features from a parent class - [more on this can be found in Inheritance below](#Inheritance). If the class is not inheriting, the parentheses will generally be left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class names should gnerally use the CapWords convention with an initial capital letter, which helps distinguish them from functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a class has been created, instances of it can be created and stored as variables. As with built-in classes, any number of instances of user-created classes can be created. Since there are no limitations on how many lists, dictionaries, or DataFrames that can be created the same is true for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "polly = Parrot()\n",
    "molly = Parrot()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, two objects have been created - one called **`polly`** and one called **`molly`**. They are both created from the **`Parrot`** class, but are distinct objects. As with two separate lists, changes can be made to one parrot without effecting the other. "

    "\n",
    "### `__init__`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a range of different things that can be added to a class, but arguably the most important is the [Magic Method](#Magic-Methods): **`__init__`**. This is an in-built Python command that is used to initialise the class - it is called when an object is first created. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`__init__()`** works like any other function. Arguments can be passed into it, it can define variables, it can run other functions and do calculations. As it is called when an object is first initialised, it can be used to set up any fundamental properties of the class - things which are essential, and all examples of the class must have. \n",
    "\n",

    "class Parrot():\n",

    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        self.name = name```\n",
    "        \n",
    "Within this example, **`__init__()`** has two parameters, **`self`**, and **`name`**. **`self`** is a key part of classes, and allows for defined variables to be accessed within the wider class object, rather than being limited in scope to the function they are defined within. Generally, all methods within a class will have an inital parameter of **`self`**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second parameter, **`name`**, allows for a user to define their parrot object with a specific name. The line **`self.name = name`** takes the argument that the user defines, and stores it in the class wide **`self.name`** attribute, rather than their name being only usable within the **`__init__()`** method.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Taking a common object, the pandas DataFrame, it has attributes such as **`shape`**, **`dtypes`**, and **`columns`**. These are all things that describe parts of the DataFrame - the number of rows and columns, the data types of the columns, and the names of the columns respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame also has methods such as **`merge`**, **`drop_duplicates`**, and **`dropna`** - to combine DataFrames, remove any non-distinct rows, and to remove null values. These all do things to the DataFrame, and generally have names with verbs in them. When used, they require a pair of parentheses **`()`** and have a number of mandatory and optional parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined classes can equally have any number of attributes and methods. In the earlier examples, the parrot has a **`name`** attribute, and then the **`can_fly`** attribute was created with a default value. As with Python in general, the only limit to the number of attributes and methods is the amount of computational power available, and the patience to write the code. "

    "There are a number of magic methods which can be used to both compare objects, and combine them together. It is trivial to understand how to compare two strings or integers - if the strings are the same, **`string_a == string_b`** will return true, likewise for an integer. Greater than and less than behave well - they compare numbers on a numerical scale, and compare strings alphabetically. This comparison can be expanded to user-defined classes as well with a little bit of work. \n",

    "* **`__ne__`** - defines behaviour for **n**on **e**quivalence -  **`!=`**\n",
    "* **`__lt__`** - defines behaviour for **l**ess **t**han - **`<`**\n",
    "* **`__gt__`** - defines behaviour for **g**reater **t**han - **`>`**\n",
    "* **`__le__`** - defines behaviour for **l**ess than or **e**qual to - **`<=`**\n",
    "* **`__ge__`** - defines behaviour for **g**reater than or **e**qual to - **`>=`**\n",

For numbers, addition and multiplication clearly are commutative, while subtraction and division are not. In python, string combination using the addition operator is not commutative - **`\"a\" + \"b\" == \"ab\"`**, while **`\"b\" + \"a\" == \"ba\"`**. For user-defined classes, should they be commutative? Again, it will depend on the class in question. \n",

However, **`other_thing + object`** will by default not work, as the class definition of **`other_thing`** will be called, and its **`__add__`** method used to handle the addition, which almost certainly *won't* work for the other class. \n",
    "\n",

    "* **`__radd__`** - defines reflected behaviour for **add**ition - **`+`**\n",
    "* **`__rsub__`** - defines reflected behaviour for **sub**traction -  **`-`**\n",
    "* **`__rmul__`** - defines reflected behaviour for the **mul**tiplication - **`*`**\n",
    "* **`__rpow__`** - defines reflected behaviour for the **pow**er operator - __`**`__\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some methods for handling operators such as **`+=`** - for assignment coupled with addition. These are generally the same as the normal ones above, but instead have an **`i`** at the beginning - **`i`** standing for **`in-place`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`__iadd__`** - defines behaviour for **add**ition with assignment - **`+=`**\n",
    "* **`__isub__`** - defines behaviour for **sub**traction with assignment -  **`-=`**\n",
    "* **`__imul__`** - defines behaviour for the **mul**tiplication with assignment - **`*=`**\n",
    "* **`__ipow__`** - defines behaviour for the **pow**er operator with assignment - __`**=`__ \n",
    "\n",
    "If the processes in the original method are commutative, then generally the reflective and assignation operators can simply return the core method to save having to duplicate code:\n",

    "Objects once defined can be changed, in a number of ways. Python doesn't have public and private methods in the same way that many other languages such as Java or C# do, but it does have some conventions. In general, any functions, or class based variables which have a name beginning with an underscore are considered to be private, and should only be accessed from other methods inside the object. They will not show up in any autofill lists provided by IDEs, but as it is just convention, they can be used outside, despite it being inadvisable. \n",
    "\n",
    "As any attribute is accessible within an object, changing it can be as simple as running: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "polly.name = 'Penelope'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need, again unlike Java, to create get or set methods - methods to call an attribute of a class, and to change its value. It is straightforward to do so, by just adding a couple of extra methods to the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_name(self):\n",
    "    return self.name\n",
    "\n",
    "def set_name(self, new_name):\n",
    "    self.name = new_name    \n",

    "However, this is often unnecessary, and it is both clunkier for the user, and less intuitive. Adding get or set methods could be useful if some validation is needed, for example ensuring that a new name is text rather than an integer, but thankfully Python provides us with a useful tool for allowing the definition of methods that act like the above, but directly affect the output when attributes are referred to directly - the **`property`** function.   \n"
